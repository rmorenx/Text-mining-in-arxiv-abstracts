       "  'abstract': '  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\\naccretion curtain model.\\n',\n",

Given a Lie group action that generates transport\\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\\n',\n",

Computations carried out\\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\\n',\n",

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\\napplications are discussed in detail.\\n',\n",

In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\\nwaves in slowly varying media.\\n',\n",

A difficult problem of AE analysis is\\nseparation and characterization of signal components when the signals from\\nvarious sources and the mode of mixing are unknown.

The global\\ndefinitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various\\nrelationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler\\nmanifolds are found.

The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well\\naccounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)\\ncalculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from\\npure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite\\ninterlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive\\ninteractions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals\\ndensity functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The\\nuse of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal\\nparameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and\\npotassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding\\nseparation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are\\nreported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are\\nreported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal\\napproach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.\\n',\n",

The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \\\\pm 0.000010$ days, with\\nan orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \\\\pm 0.021$. We demonstrate\\ngenerally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined\\nbinary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the\\nlight curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique\\nline in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we\\nassume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation\\nhas been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line\\nbroadening, $V_{\\\\rm rot} \\\\sin i_{\\\\rm rot} = 28.9 \\\\pm 1.0$ \\\\kms, gives a primary\\nradius of $R_{\\\\rm A} = 1.28 \\\\pm 0.04$ \\\\rsun.

As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg\\nequations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for\\nuniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some\\nclass of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their\\ngeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity\\nof all Heisenberg equations.

That implies\\ncorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction\\nof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation\\nrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables\\nis reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed\\nthe requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum\\nmean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the\\nonly known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not\\ncontradict to the existing data.\\n',\n",

Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are\\nimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two\\ntypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also\\nhave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is\\nundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation\\nbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation\\nfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and\\ncorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale\\nrandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two\\ndots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the\\ncorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical\\nfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and\\nSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with\\ncorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature\\na stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical\\nanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\\nwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the\\nsmooth and holomorphic setting.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way\\ndepends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover\\nmass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue\\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\\n(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not\\ndepend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the\\nglobular cluster system.\\n\",\n",

We consider\\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\\\sim\\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically.

       "  'abstract': '  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\\nspace-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\\nspace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\\nconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\\npp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\\nbackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\\nequations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\\ncan be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.\\n',\n",

The light curve repository website\\n(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and\\ndeep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed.

       "  'abstract': '  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a\\nnearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit\\'s inclination with respect\\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.\\n',\n",

The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the\\ncluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a\\nbimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular\\nclusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations\\nsuggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar\\ncollisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer\\nprocesses in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial\\ndistribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal\\nradius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an\\n\"evaporating\" BSS.\\n',\n",

The DMRG results of the\\nzero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear\\nsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is\\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\\nthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the\\nsusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the\\npeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the\\ncouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings\\nleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,\\nthe experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization\\nfor the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with\\nour TMRG results.\\n',\n",

The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability\\ndensity functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose\\nkernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)\\nthe conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based\\nupon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information\\nand the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.\\nWith the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the\\nexperimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference\\nbetween this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of\\ndata represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the\\ntrue properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the\\nredundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number\\nof data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual\\ninformation is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the\\nvariables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is\\nused to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the\\nintroduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly\\nrelated variables.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale\\natomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results crucially\\ndepends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys like\\nquasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically\\ninexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials\\nespecially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force\\nmatching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to\\noptimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen\\nreference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio\\nmethods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co,\\nicosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have\\nbeen constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of\\nspecialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\\\\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\\\\infty$\\nfoliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and\\nclassification of pairs $(M,\\\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In\\nthis setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\\\cite{Reeb} states that a manifold\\nadmitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.\\nIn particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these\\nlines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \\\\cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a\\nreal-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In\\nthe present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To\\ndo this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities\\nand the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an\\nelimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle\\nconfigurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if\\nother classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,\\nproved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At\\nthis purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\\\\F)$ of the foliation $\\\\F$, we\\nconsider {\\\\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components\\nadmitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\\\F)$ admits\\nonly weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic\\nto $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of\\na closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type\\nresult.\\n\",\n",

The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a\\nwide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission\\npeaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties\\nof the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are\\nmainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by\\nthe perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated\\non-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about\\ntwo orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the\\nexperimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior\\nwithin a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or\\nS for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.\\n\",\n",

By\\nanalysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse\\nproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:\\nQSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,\\n$\\\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\\\vartheta=16.28$\\narcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\\ncreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\\ncorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\\nthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\\nUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\\nforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\\nmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\\nline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\\non the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\\nspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\\nQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.\\n',\n",

These knots\\nare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein\\nfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein\\nData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered\\nones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most\\ncomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that\\nits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the\\nproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and\\nsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only\\nappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of\\nsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the\\nenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a\\nshort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a\\nknotted structure in this protein.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, and\\ntypes $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter\\ngroups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\\\\si_1\\\\si_2 cdots\\\\si_d$ of a\\nCoxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\\\\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in a\\nsubgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisation\\nis \"minimal\" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$\\'s,\\n$i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these\\ndecomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$\\ndecomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a\\nsomewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$\\ndecomposition numbers from results of B\\\\\\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on\\nmap enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.\\nThese results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and\\nfixed integers $r_1\\\\le r_2\\\\le ...\\\\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\\\\pi_1\\\\le\\n\\\\pi_2\\\\le ...\\\\le \\\\pi_l$ in Armstrong\\'s generalised non-crossing partitions\\nposet, where the poset rank of $\\\\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the \"block\\nstructure\" of $\\\\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies\\nall known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing\\npartitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain\\nenumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.\\nMoreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain\\nenumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,\\nin turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong\\'s $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star\\ncluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42\\nclass II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I\\nprotostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\\naccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census\\nof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\\nwith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\\na B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\\nabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find\\nthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that\\nrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,\\nstarless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population\\nindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that\\nthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its\\nsmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While\\nit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of\\ndynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings\\nsupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller\\nsub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the\\nsupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should\\nnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the\\nreceiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively\\nactivates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of\\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\\n',\n",

Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray\\nemission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a\\npower law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the\\nX-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than\\nthe radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly\\noffset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7\\narcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope\\nCompact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio\\nTelescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some\\nareas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index\\nof ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of\\nL_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc.

       "  'abstract': '  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an\\napproach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and\\nrepresentation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the\\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the\\ndescription of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the\\ndiversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be\\nidentified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type\\nin the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\\nobservations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\\n1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\\nbeen previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\\nobtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\\nNovember and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\\nslope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\\n0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\\nof a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\\nquestions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\\nnever been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\\nit. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\\nby the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\\ntogether with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\\nmay be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\\nBelt.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged\\ngauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such\\nparticles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In\\nthis paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling\\nhelicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\\\\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery\\nchannel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution,\\nreconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides\\nthe best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires\\nintegrated luminosities of $\\\\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV\\nand provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This\\nhelicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various\\ndiscovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference\\nregime, but with higher integrated luminosities.\\n\",\n",

Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve\\nbetter than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond\\nwith careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric\\nPLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope\\nthat will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet\\nmass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase\\nastrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal\\ncollecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy\\nto 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass\\nplanets possible.\\n  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique\\nvolume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter\\nspace of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large\\nradii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the\\ntargets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active\\nstars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,\\ncoronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity\\nwill extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric\\nmethods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.\\n  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods\\ndemonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap\\nfor exoplanet discovery and characterization.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical\\npossibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.\\nThe basic idea of these invisibility devices \\\\cite{glu1, glu2, le},\\\\cite{pss1}\\nis to use anisotropic {\\\\it transformation media} whose permittivity and\\npermeability $\\\\var^{\\\\lambda\\\\nu}, \\\\mu^{\\\\lambda\\\\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,\\n$\\\\var_0^{\\\\lambda\\\\nu}, \\\\mu^{\\\\lambda\\\\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular\\ntransformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking\\nin the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.\\nThis formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical\\nproblems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the\\npermeability of the {\\\\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked\\nobjects. We write Maxwell\\'s equations in Schr\\\\\"odinger form with the\\nelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that\\nthe electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially\\nself-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily\\nequivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium\\n$\\\\var_0^{\\\\lambda\\\\nu}, \\\\mu^{\\\\lambda\\\\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the\\ncoordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the\\nscattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the\\nconstruction of \\\\cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \\\\cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and\\nactive devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove\\ncloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove\\nthat it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the\\nformation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main\\npredictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical\\nperturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the\\nevolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require\\nbetter KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly\\nconsistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial\\ncollisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important\\nproblems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.\\nContrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids\\nsuggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification\\nof more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide\\nadditional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and\\ndynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate\\ncalculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'\\ncalculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and\\nevolution.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak\\nlensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging\\ngalaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\\n\",\n",

The spectral energy\\ndistribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with\\nflux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very\\nhigh energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet\\nmodel to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our\\nmultiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce\\nthe observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value\\nfor the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due\\nto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the\\nhigh-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence\\nof a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role\\nin the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to\\nthe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and\\ngamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton\\nemission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral\\nvariability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis\\npatterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day\\ntime scales.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of\\nplanetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around\\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\\nfrom the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that\\nthe host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary\\nsystem.\\n',\n",

As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be\\nresponsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate\\ncomponents, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period\\nbinaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct\\nthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more\\nproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either\\nduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the\\nfirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common\\nenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive\\nwhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents\\ninterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope\\nevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual\\nformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most\\nplausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the\\ncommon envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget\\nexplicitly including recombination resolves this issue.\\n',\n",

Primordial binary frequencies in these\\nmodels range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and\\ninclude a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and\\nthe tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a\\ncluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late\\ntimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the\\ncentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\\n-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\\nbinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\\n(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in\\nthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of\\nmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces\\nthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled\\ninto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in\\nstars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius\\nup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the\\nexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or\\nless). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial\\nbinary content of globular clusters.\\n',\n",

A longstanding\\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\\nhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\\nalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\\nreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\\nmulti-jet observables.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen\\n(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\\ndwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\\nelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\\nunless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\\nearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in\\ntheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the\\ncircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has\\nbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\\n',\n",

In this paper, we introduce a new type of\\nnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose\\nan evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network\\nstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\\nstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of\\nthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the\\nintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial\\ndisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of\\nnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting\\nintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network\\nso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,\\nit is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world\\neffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering\\ncoefficient in a network.\\n',\n",

Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and\\nintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local\\nmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,\\nearly-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type\\ngalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The\\nuncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include\\nuncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the\\ngalaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive\\nblack hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.\\nThat is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)\\nh^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in\\nsupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.\\n\",\n",

The solution is derived by the application of the Laplace and\\nFourier transforms in closed form in terms of the H-function. The results\\nderived are of general nature and include the results investigated earlier by\\nmany authors, notably by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) for the fundamental\\nsolution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation, and Saxena et al.\\n(2006a, b) for fractional reaction- diffusion equations. The advantage of using\\nRiesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional\\nreaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental\\nsolution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization\\nof neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and\\ntime-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be\\ninterpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are\\nexpressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.\\n',\n",

We show that, for\\nthermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\\\\mu$K to 400\\n$\\\\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the\\nadsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the\\nheating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free\\ndownward decay) rate is negligible.\\n',\n",

The survey allows us to investigate six\\nfamilies (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5\\ncloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The\\nsample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception\\nof the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and\\nP-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the\\nexception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is\\ndetected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type\\nasteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer\\ntransition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans\\nas compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the\\nproperties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The\\nanalysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows\\nthat the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We\\nperform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property\\ndistributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in\\ncomparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.\\nTrojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher\\ninclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.\\n\",\n",

Four stars appear to be too\\ndistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our\\nobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were\\nderived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list.

       "  'abstract': '  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general\\nnetworks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have\\na fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These\\neffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\\ntopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\\ndescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\\nstructure to the repeated prisoner\\'s dilemma we uncover a novel and\\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner\\'s\\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\\n',\n",

In our analysis we also took into account $\\\\nu_\\\\mu\\n\\\\to \\\\nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile\\nneutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is\\nsignificantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.\\nData from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the\\nfour-neutrino model parameter space.

       "  'abstract': \"  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits\\naround a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in\\nQ, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.\\nThis system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation\\nreaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the\\nCarter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\\nthese three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\\ncomputed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is\\nlinear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\\nthe spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction\\nfield), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\\nquadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\\norbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\\naxis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\\nsingle mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,\\nto linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we\\nshow that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a\\nsystem (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional\\nassumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric\\nspacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain\\nwill help to understand its function and may provide insights into many\\nproperties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to\\ntheir dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex\\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\\nsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'\\nconnectivity.\\n\",\n",

In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and\\ndirections of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for\\nSRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that\\nsatisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in\\nthe defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial\\ningredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for\\nsolutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to\\nshow weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance\\nprinciple, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some\\nsufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in\\nconvex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the\\npolyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries\\nand possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.\\n',\n",

We detect and confirm the protostellar\\nstatus for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity for\\nCB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir} \\\\approx 8 L_\\\\sun$, and we estimate a\\ncentral source mass of $M_* \\\\approx 0.8 M_\\\\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of\\n${\\\\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\\\\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source\\n(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is\\nconsistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B\\nstar or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is\\nthat the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high\\ninclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central\\nprotostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.\\nIn addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are\\nspatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source\\ntemperatures ($\\\\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the\\ndense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0\\nprotostars.\\n',\n",

This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional\\nconditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The\\nconclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing\\nhorizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\\nproduct spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\\nwarped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\\nthe types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\\nsimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\\npossibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\\nthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''\\ntype D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\\ngeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,\\nhowever, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit\\nnon-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in\\nany n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D\\nWeyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \\\\Phi_{ij}. In the case with\\n``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''\\ncase \\\\Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \\\\Phi_{ij} coincide with those\\nof the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike\\ndirections of the spacetime.

       "  'abstract': '  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD\\n70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age\\nestimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations\\nof this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our\\nspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about\\n100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\\nsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\\nthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a\\nperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of\\nthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3\\ndays. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff\\nvariation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation\\nbetween the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the\\nrotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the\\nlong-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass\\ncompanion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial\\nvelocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host\\nstar, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which\\nlies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.\\nThe orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery\\naround the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris\\ndisks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  We report results from a 30 ks observation of Cygnus X-1 with the High Energy\\nTransmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\\\\em Chandra X-ray\\nObservatory}. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.\\nThe lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,\\nsome of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,\\nhowever, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of\\nthe present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \\\\AA\\\\\\nwas about $5 \\\\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of\\nthe observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of\\n$0.06 \\\\times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This\\nimplies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale\\nof hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the\\nobservation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are\\ngenerally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the\\nbinary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical\\ncondition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a\\nstatistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth-masses and\\norbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs to\\nall the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of\\nplanets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide\\nresults on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with\\nshort lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a\\nspace-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other\\nmethods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive\\nstatistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets\\nthat a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet\\nsensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of\\nthe Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify\\nand determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of\\nplanets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is\\nlikely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature\\nof planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and\\nhabitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an\\nexample of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these\\nobjectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the\\nNASA Discovery Program cost cap.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '  We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micron\\naround the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James\\nClerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk\\naround TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron\\nflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)\\nassuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes\\nthe TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk\\nreported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk\\ndetected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\\nyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\\ndisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the\\ndust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures\\naccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a\\nmodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures\\naccording to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in\\nthe TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of\\ndisks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.\\ndebris) as a function of spectral type.\\n',\n",

We base our\\nwork mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided\\nhigh-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably\\nmodeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the\\ndetermination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\\nempirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\\nfrom a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\\npre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\\nrate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier\\nsuggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the\\ndisk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can\\nbe fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color\\ncorrection factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra\\nwith other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is\\ndominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by\\nstate-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data from XMM-Newton\\nof the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess\\nemission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft\\nexcess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines\\nin the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton\\nobservations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the\\nposition of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant\\nazimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally\\nwell with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is\\nneither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with\\nmodels of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using\\nthe data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not\\nconfirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected\\nproperties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed\\nproperties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal\\ninterpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated\\nwith the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been\\nprovided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying\\npopulation might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.\\n',\n",

We incorporate a new method for including the\\nradiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic\\nsimulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,\\nled to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to\\nthe low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with\\ncosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with\\nmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The\\nsimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5\\nMsolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core\\nreveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4\\nZsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with\\nmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share\\nmost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass\\nproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=\\n10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\\nlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second\\ngeneration stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more\\nmassive on average than stars formed in the local universe.\\n',\n",

The skeletons are\\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\\nthere is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases\\nmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending\\nrigidity regime that was not studied here.

       "  'abstract': '  We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can\\nhelp each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in\\nthe single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the\\nmyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing\\nproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the\\nsource to the destination. We find that for a given route, the\\ndecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative\\ncoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by\\nthe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative\\ncoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms\\nof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm\\nruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that\\nruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when\\nthe nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies\\nusing practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of\\nthe strategies on different routes.\\n',\n",

This approximation\\nis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The\\npair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of\\nprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and\\nanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population\\ndensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through\\na Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions\\nand, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on\\ninitial conditions.

       "  'abstract': \"  Intermediate polars (IPs) are cataclysmic variables which contain magnetic\\nwhite dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period.\\nEvolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through\\nthe 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the\\nresulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are\\nknown, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved\\nspectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the\\nIP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains\\na white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We\\nestimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \\\\approx 2 x 10^33 G\\ncm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed\\nshort-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest\\nthat long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards\\nshorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,\\nwhich have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their\\norbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with\\nspin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.\\n\",\n",

The observations resolved the\\nhot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial\\nresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located\\nwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar\\ndensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows\\nus to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature\\nstructure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core\\ntemperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial\\ndifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced\\nat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature\\nsensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The\\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\\nhot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot\\ncore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for\\nthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main\\nsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the\\nlarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the\\ncentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are\\nconsistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude\\nthe outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative\\ncauses of this velocity pattern.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,\\none-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has\\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\\n',\n",

Understanding the mechanisms which\\nlead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete\\npicture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster\\nformation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial\\nvariations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &\\nMatteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the\\ndistribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric\\nradius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular\\nclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the\\nobserved multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can\\nbe, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar\\npopulations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population\\nof globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very\\ngood agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate\\nthe impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity\\ndistribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of\\nmerger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity\\ntransformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model\\n(abridged)\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in April 2005\\nwith INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray\\nBinaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data\\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\\n~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic\\noutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of\\nOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source\\nbehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The\\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\\nof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a\\nSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\\nthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an\\noutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,\\nand they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost\\nquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously\\nthought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the\\nbrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly\\nincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit\\nwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous\\naccretion.\\n',\n",

The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed\\n[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density\\nlimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and\\nignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have\\nlower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line\\nflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that\\ndifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in\\nthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit\\nand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the\\ntorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of\\nextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line\\nratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities\\nassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We\\nalso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended\\nand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from\\nlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from\\nsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby\\ngalaxies.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone\\nvector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To\\nthis end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the\\nnonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\\\mu\\n}\\\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\\\mu})=\\\\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is\\nconsidered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\\n',\n",

In particular, using a fully covariant\\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\\\it\\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\\\pi^{-}/\\\\pi^{+})$- and\\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon\\npotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative\\napproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results\\nshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a\\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude\\nthat particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear\\nequation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its\\nisovector sector.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been\\nexpressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin\\nwave function at filling factor $\\\\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the\\nPfaffian wave function at $\\\\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general\\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\\nvertex operators, $P_{\\\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\\\rm\\nth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\\nstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that\\ndescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general\\nclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and\\n$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a\\ngeneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other\\nfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling\\nfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.\\n\",\n",

Using a parametric model, we find that almost\\nall s-elements were made in a single neutron exposure. This star should be a\\nmember of a post-common-envelope binary. After the s-process material has\\nexperienced only one neutron exposure in the nucleosynthesis region and is\\ndredged-up to its envelope, the AGB evolution is terminated by the onset of\\ncommon-envelope evolution. Based on the high radial-velocity of HE 1305-0007,\\nwe speculate that the star could be a runaway star from a binary system, in\\nwhich the AIC event has occurred and produced the r-process elements.\\n',\n",

Yet,\\nobservations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation\\nefficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this\\ntension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust\\nformation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first\\ntime, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to\\ntheir survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.\\nWe find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun\\nstellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between\\n2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on\\ntime-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by\\nthe hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller\\ngrains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that\\nderived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of\\nsmall grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports\\nthe idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present\\nin SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"  We analyze 27 house price indexes of Las Vegas from Jun. 1983 to Mar. 2005,\\ncorresponding to 27 different zip codes. These analyses confirm the existence\\nof a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster than\\nexponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited time\\ninterval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and has\\nprogressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable to\\npre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for a\\nmedium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly\\nperiodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from\\nmonth to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could\\nconfirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned\\nto ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution\\nof the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.\\n2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant\\nvariations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems\\nto have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two\\nyears earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of\\nthe USA).\\n\",\n",

Gas and dust\\nproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent\\ndisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved\\nboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar\\nmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk\\ninclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position\\nangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7\\nmm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.\\nThe dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200\\nAU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and\\nCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,\\nwe obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.\\nWe argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is\\nstrongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of\\ndust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of\\nlarge bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the\\ndust distribution by a low mass companion.\\n',\n",

We\\nanalyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs\\nbosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by\\ncombining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on\\nfull simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM\\nHiggs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios\\nin terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We\\nstudy the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta\\nplane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects\\narise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via\\nhigher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into\\nsupersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\\\\mu$ can shift the\\nprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by\\nabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable\\nwith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the\\ndiscovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy\\nneutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should\\nbe achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM\\nparameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM\\nHiggs bosons at the LHC.\\n\",\n",

By inspecting\\nsigned-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the\\ncorrelation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and\\ninstrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all\\nsignificant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the\\nISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced\\nbetween the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the\\nUniverse. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our\\ndetection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for\\ndark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to\\nhelp us to better understand the nature of dark energy.\\n',\n",

We present a\\nnew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards\\nboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is\\nable to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet\\ntransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time\\nbetween transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer\\nthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass\\nthat is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique\\ncomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion\\nresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced\\nsensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the\\nphotometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV\\nplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of\\nhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing\\ntelescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting\\nplanets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.\\nA relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\\\\sim 0.5\\n{\\\\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically\\nincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.\\n',\n",

This holds even for\\nloops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops\\nare below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that\\nsmall-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to\\nimperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in\\nespecially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright\\nrelative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the\\nability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do\\nnot expand systematically with height is robust.\\n\",\n",

A neural circuit can be thought of as a\\ndirected multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.\\nIt has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is\\nmanifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that\\ncircuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients\\nof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those\\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\\nbe impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible\\nexplanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain\\nhas been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential\\nbehavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance\\nto hemodynamics has been outlined.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths\\nof supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming\\ngalaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)\\nabsorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that\\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can\\nproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude\\nthat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a\\ncatalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS\\nStripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz\\nsystem for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we\\ncompute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and\\nstudy variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter\\nthan g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g\\nand r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)\\nquasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted\\nflux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the\\n0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for\\nfinding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high\\nGalactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for\\nquasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the\\nvariable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main\\nstellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of\\nlightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar\\nlocus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like\\nbehavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo\\nsubstructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to\\nexpected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that\\nit will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million\\nlow-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.\\n',\n",

Constraining the properties\\nof the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative\\ntransfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation\\nfield using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray\\nbackground. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and\\nthe hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating\\nbecause of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible\\nrange of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to\\nradiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data\\nfrom in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the\\nheliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to\\nconstrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column\\ndensities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the\\nobservational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)\\nand T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron\\ndensity in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-\\n0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with\\nsub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however\\nC is supersolar.

These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are\\nfound for substantially different input radiation fields.

       "  'abstract': '  The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar Type\\nIc supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar/hypernova model, in which\\nthe GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive\\nstar to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxies\\nsuggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the\\ncollapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star\\nmodels are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive\\nhelium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during\\ncore-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few\\nmillennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent\\nevolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence\\ncompanions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars\\nin close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the\\nstrong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain\\nsufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch\\nelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These\\ndistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic\\neffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport\\nalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the\\nelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we\\nbegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic\\nstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations\\nencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are\\ncomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states\\nof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,\\nusing previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic\\nstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can\\ndescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the\\npresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the\\nsubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which\\nleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several\\norders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched\\nstructure.\\n',\n",

Such a dynamical evolution process is included\\nhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of\\ntransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and\\nLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\\ndissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs\\nvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet\\nccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are\\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\\nstage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the\\nsuppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a\\nbulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and\\nthe ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon\\ncollisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an\\nindicator of a deconfined partonic medium.

In this framework, the $\\\\Lambda$\\ncold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds\\nto a harmonic oscillator.

       "  'abstract': \"  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal\\ntransmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical\\nthreshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of\\nstochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input\\nsignals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small\\namounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR\\nin the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between\\nShannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for\\noptimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is\\nachieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the\\nnoise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal\\ndistribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical\\nverification and justification for previous work in both computational\\nneuroscience and electronics.\\n\",\n",

The high spatial resolution of the MSX\\nobservations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the\\nsky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches\\nwell the orientation expected from the proper motion.

We demonstrate that the square of the\\nspin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and\\n$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition\\nbetween the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign\\nmeans an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a\\ndestruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state\\nbelow the first order ferromagnetic transition.\\n',\n",

In the limit of extreme\\nblockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a\\npolymer-polymer demixing transition. Some consequences are discussed for the\\nsynthesis of partially modified polymers, and the experimental characterisation\\nof such systems.\\n',\n",

This inverse problem - known as electrical\\nimpedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has\\nfocussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,\\nno work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper\\naims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative\\nof the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface\\n$\\\\partial\\\\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the\\ngeometry of $\\\\partial \\\\omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives\\nneeded to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the\\nstability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely\\nill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.\\n',\n",

A particle motion in\\nthis system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface\\ndensity of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,\\nwe sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle\\nmotion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a\\nfinite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these\\ndifferent chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we\\ninvestigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that\\nsuch a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy\\nspectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different\\nfrom that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion.

       "  'abstract': \"  Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have\\nsuggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope\\nnear zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black\\nhole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux\\nemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state\\ninterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is\\nsimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at\\nwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between\\n`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does\\nhave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN\\nand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an\\nimproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on\\nconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of\\ncontinuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well\\nfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.\\nAlthough a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by\\nadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not\\nunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second\\nbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate\\nimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found\\nin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other\\nAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.\\n\",\n",

The observed SEDs are\\nmodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using\\nthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated\\nwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red\\nquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are\\nused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black\\nholes residing in these AGN.\\n  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)\\nbands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed\\nnear- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the\\nrange ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is\\n~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al.

We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a\\nrefinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This\\nequation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is\\nthe sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.\\nThe case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real\\nHaar MRA.

This fact implies that there exist infinity many different\\n2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\\\\cL}^2(\\\\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar\\nMRA. All of these bases are constructed.

       "  'abstract': '  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled\\nstate, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well\\ndefined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the\\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or\\nmechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Onsager conjectured that weak solutions of the Euler equations for\\nincompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimal\\nsmoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipate\\nenergy if they are rougher. In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for\\nvelocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\\\\NN)}$. We show that this space\\nis sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the\\nLittlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by\\nlocal interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;\\nmoreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to\\n$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\\\\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, the\\nstrong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.\\n',\n",

The Compton-thin\\nnature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the\\nUnified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of this\\narticle is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in the\\ncircumnuclear region of NGC 7679 in search for the presence of a hidden Sy1\\nnucleus, using the [O III] 5007 luminosity as a tracer of AGN activity. The [O\\nIII] 5007 image of the NGC 7679 shows elliptical isophotes extended along the\\nPA ~ 80 deg in the direction to the counterpart galaxy NGC 7682. The maximum of\\nionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007/Halpha ratio\\nis displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus.

We find that this emerging\\nmarket exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to\\ndeveloped markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to\\nbe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.\\nBy comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to\\nthe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector\\nidentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network\\nof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\\nwith a two-factor model.

A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in\\nthe range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent\\nclassifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to\\nlocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface\\nmass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local\\ngalaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density\\nrelation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local\\nprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the\\nnearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more\\nimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of\\nthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the\\ngalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red\\ngalaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from\\nCOMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive\\ngalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription\\nof Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describes\\nan intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,\\nsupporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformed\\ninto S0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.\\n',\n",

We show that, for lines\\nthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line\\ncritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming\\nmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar\\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a\\nsimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous\\ncan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic\\nluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and\\nnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict\\nthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which\\nthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may\\nbe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate\\ncritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high\\nredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.\\nhint at just such a change in slope.

For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability\\ndistribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure\\nstate density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple\\ngenerating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit\\ntrace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent\\nrelations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under\\ncontraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.\\nAs examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we\\nconsider a quantum system evolving by It\\\\^o stochastic and by jump process\\nSchr\\\\\"odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace\\nformalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian\\nmotion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov\\nmaster equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies\\ngeneralizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett\\nmaster equation.

We solve numerically\\nthe coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the\\nspin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode\\namplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,\\nthe mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is\\nreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.\\nEventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a\\ncyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a\\nfull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational\\nradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long\\ntimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway\\n(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are\\nshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary\\nproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature\\nT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA\\nreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to\\nranges of these parameters.

       "  'abstract': '  We present the fourth edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar\\nCatalog. The catalog contains 77,429 objects; this is an increase of over\\n30,000 entries since the previous edition. The catalog consists of the objects\\nin the SDSS Fifth Data Release that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22.0\\n(in a cosmology with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7)\\nhave at least one emission line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s, or have\\ninteresting/complex absorption features, are fainter than i=15.0, and have\\nhighly reliable redshifts. The area covered by the catalog is 5740 sq. deg. The\\nquasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.48; the\\ncatalog includes 891 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 36 are at\\nredshifts greater than five. Approximately half of the catalog quasars have i <\\n19; nearly all have i < 21. For each object the catalog presents positions\\naccurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz)\\nCCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the\\nmorphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio,\\nnear-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available,\\nfrom other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the\\nwavelength region 3800--9200A at a spectral resolution of ~2000. The spectra\\ncan be retrieved from the public database using the information provided in the\\ncatalog. The average SDSS colors of quasars as a function of redshift, derived\\nfrom the catalog entries, are presented in tabular form. Approximately 96% of\\nthe objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS.\\n',\n",

For many decades\\nsurveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,\\nas we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an\\nefficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to\\nmap intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address\\nsome problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide\\nfield surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the\\nexciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,\\nthe measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field\\nstudying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then\\nlook briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,\\nPanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all\\nwavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.\\nI examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be\\ntoo expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the\\nfirst is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and\\nthe second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.\\n',\n",

The equivalent width of the D lines\\nis computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)\\nof the stars.

       "  'abstract': '  This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black hole\\nmagnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect\\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux\\ndominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the\\nergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified\\nlimit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the\\nergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for\\ngreatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux\\nthat is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of\\nelectromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux\\nthreading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading\\nthe equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central\\nengine of powerful FRII quasars.\\n',\n",

The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\\nmodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to\\nmain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity.

For the honeycomb\\npinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings\\nB/B_\\\\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent\\nexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally\\noccur at B/B_\\\\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced\\nmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\\\\phi=n. At the\\nnoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the\\ninterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer\\nstates that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states\\n\"vortex molecular crystals\" and \"vortex plastic crystals\" since they are\\nsimilar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.\\nWe argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with\\ncertain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that\\nkagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical\\ncurrent above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.\\n',\n",

Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D\\nmodel, one will have or have no the coexistence phase of the two condensates,\\nbesides the pure $<qq>$ condensate phase. The $G_S-H_S$ (or $G_S-H_P$) phase\\ndiagrams in these models are given. The results also implicate a real\\nconstraint on two-flavor QCD-analogous NJL model.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of\\nelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that\\nthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars\\nwithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin\\nhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces\\nmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of\\nobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution\\nwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\\ngeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as\\nhad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly\\ndependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from\\ndwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.\\n',\n",

Finally, we\\ndiscuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject\\nto external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with the\\nexperimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spin\\nrelaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phonon\\nemission.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,\\nknown as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a\\nsource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as\\nscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One\\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data\\nfor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are\\npresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this\\ncompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV\\nthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the\\nvariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the\\nflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and\\n10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m\\nUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the\\nvariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of\\nthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic\\nannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is\\nin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting\\na simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency\\ndependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the\\nscattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The\\nlatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.\\n',\n",

The\\nmodels have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for\\nsystem-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject\\nfaults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and\\nrecovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault\\nmodels are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk\\nfailures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the\\ndisks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given\\nsubmodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the\\nlower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and\\nanalyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate\\n(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms\\nimplemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the\\naccumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.\\n',\n",

We find a size-dependent cumulative\\nadvantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.\\nIn previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research\\ngroups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property\\nof the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a\\nlarger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than\\ntop-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance\\nuniversities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with\\nsize. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a\\nuniversity, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the\\naverage research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance\\nuniversities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of\\nactivities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive\\npower. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities\\nthe field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations\\nper publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation\\ndensity found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of\\nthe science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with\\nsignificantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance\\nuniversities.

Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)\\nthrough a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)\\nthrough a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field\\nstrength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,\\nmaking different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of\\nrelativistic electrons.\\n  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is\\nnot aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of\\nambient magnetic field strength.

       "  'abstract': '  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are\\ninvestigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\\nunsynchronizable state.\\n',\n",

For the 56 objects, we\\nconverted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy\\ndistribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. pure\\nhydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of\\neffective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are\\nestimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons\\nof 25 pc, constituting a potential 18% increase in the nearby white dwarf\\nsample. Trigonometric parallax determinations are underway via CTIOPI for these\\n20 systems.\\n  One of the DCs is cool so that it displays absorption in the near infrared.\\nUsing the distance determined via trigonometric parallax, we are able to\\nconstrain the model-dependent physical parameters and find that this object is\\nmost likely a mixed H/He atmosphere white dwarf similar to other cool white\\ndwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared\\ndue to collision-induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen.\\n',\n",

All\\nmeasurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max\\nPlanck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have also\\ncarried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using the\\nAUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find poor\\nagreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies and\\nstrengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two for\\nresonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance\\nstrengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than\\nour estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%\\n(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape between\\nthe calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partly\\nto the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states in\\nthe experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by our\\nAUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, to produce a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR rate\\ncoefficient for Fe XV forming Fe XIV. The resulting rate coefficient is\\nestimated to be accurate to better than +/- 29% (at a 90% confidence level) for\\nk_BT_e > 1 eV. At temperatures of k_BT_e ~ 2.5-15 eV, where Fe XV is predicted\\nto form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found between\\nour experimentally-derived rate coefficient and previously published\\ntheoretical results. Our new MCBP plasma rate coefficient is 19-28% smaller\\nthan our experimental results over this temperature range.\\n\",\n",

The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen\\nstatistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single\\nregion. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires\\na ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight.

Amongst the goals of our survey, one is to significantly increase\\nthe number of detected extra-solar planets in a volume-limited sample to\\nimprove our knowledge of their orbital elements distributions and thus obtain\\nbetter constraints for planet-formation models.\\n  In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbital\\nsolutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The\\nradial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1\\nM_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital\\nfit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a\\nlong-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric\\norbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.\\nThe shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal\\ntemporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We\\nfind clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile\\nvariations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.\\n',\n",

Evidence for this has been found for\\nmany families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test\\nfunctions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all\\none-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same\\ndistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.\\nWe break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction\\nterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from\\nexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and\\ndepend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the\\nexplicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing\\nsums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier\\ncoefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect\\nto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for\\nexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic\\ncurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order\\nbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank\\nover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions.

The\\ncarrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence\\nfield slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is\\na second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold\\ndark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the\\nquintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).\\nHowever, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this\\nmanner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical\\nstudy reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold\\ndark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter\\nenergy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of\\nsupersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure\\nconstant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)\\n``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)\\nthe long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a\\nRobertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3).

       "  'abstract': '  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large\\nN-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type\\ngalaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor\\nmass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\\\rm cold} <\\n0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as\\na function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and\\nsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of\\nthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo\\nmass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al\\n(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that\\ngoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type\\ngalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and\\ndoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that\\nmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,\\nand (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three\\ntrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive\\nearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,\\nour model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies\\nform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than\\n95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\\\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\\n\\\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass\\nearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major\\nmerger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central\\ncusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.\\n',\n",

We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRET\\narchives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times and\\nwere bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law\\nmodels. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6\\nlow-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac\\nobjects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral\\nindex with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for\\nspectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.\\nThere is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in\\nfive blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS\\n1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral\\ndependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We\\nobserved a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in\\nall three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were\\navailable. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the\\nwidely different flux profiles.

We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover\\nreliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is\\nrobustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed\\nto return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we\\ndetail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic\\nand real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the\\nnumber of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on\\nthe signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young\\npopulation. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover\\nbetween 2 to 5 stellar populations.

Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with\\nfirst-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear\\ndensity and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our\\nalgorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of\\nmagnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where\\nthe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding\\nand HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with\\nradiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size\\ndistributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger\\nionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean\\nhydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm\\nbrightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include\\ncorrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails\\nof the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these\\neffects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some\\npreliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to\\ndate: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We\\nshow that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such\\nlarge scales.

       "  'abstract': '  Previous molecular gas observations at arcsecond-scale resolution of the\\nSeyfert 2 galaxy M51 suggest the presence of a dense circumnuclear rotating\\ndisk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures it\\nfrom direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2)\\nobservations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating\\ndisk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image\\nthe putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to\\nbetter understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular\\ngas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region\\nof M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,\\nyielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show\\nno clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the\\nradio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate\\nfeatures located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western\\nfeature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity\\ncorrespondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting\\nthat this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated\\nnearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the\\nsame direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This\\nvelocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the\\nputative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular\\ngas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the\\njet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-\\nor Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.\\n',\n",

The\\nrate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent\\nwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal\\nmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the\\ngeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different\\nenvironments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03\\nalso shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but\\nthe trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A\\nnonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and\\nthe overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is\\nunlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the\\nsurrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;\\ninstead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star\\nformation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.\\n',\n",

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  The blazar PKS0537-441 has been observed by Swift between the end of 2004 and\\nNovember 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the\\nXRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one\\nof the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared\\ntelescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In\\nJanuary-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical\\nand X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60\\nbrighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005\\nobservation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,\\nmonitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is\\ncomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In\\nNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent\\nstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the\\nJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall\\nwell correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or\\nhours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,\\nbut the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on\\nmonthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term\\nvariability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a\\nunique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are\\ninterpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a\\njet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends\\non the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).\\n',\n",

Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic\\nand photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of\\nradial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and\\nbrightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results:\\nNew observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital\\nand spin period are equal to 4.04 hours.

       "  'abstract': \"  MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to\\nincrease channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity\\nfor mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\\nnon-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original\\nproblem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the\\ntransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates\\nLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method\\nbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient\\nmethod. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network\\nperformance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.\\n\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for\\nplanetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the\\nprobability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the\\nlensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we\\nconsider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as\\nthe ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the\\nphotometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from\\nprevious studies that the probability increases with the increase of the\\nmagnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which\\nperturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost\\noccurs at moderate magnifications of $A\\\\lesssim 20$, implying that probability\\ncan be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability\\nincreases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of\\nevents associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even\\nat magnifications as low as $A\\\\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target\\nof very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events\\nwith brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted\\nevents. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the\\nbrightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain\\nmagnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\\\\lesssim\\n10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars\\nwith magnifications $A\\\\gtrsim 70$.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of\\nprotoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular\\nmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of\\noutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications\\nfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak\\nionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able\\nto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation\\nequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk\\nmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling\\nby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the\\nconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have\\ngrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields\\ncan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are\\ngenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while\\nelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the\\nmagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.\\n  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have\\na combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated\\nto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,\\nx-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150\\ng/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have\\naggregated to 1 micron in size.\\n',\n",

       "  'abstract': '  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in\\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays at $\\\\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the\\nankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\\\\it\\nankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair\\nproduction on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\\\\it proton-dip\\nscenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\\n$\\\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\\\sim\\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\\\sim\\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\\n',\n",
